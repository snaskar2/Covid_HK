# COVID_HK

This project is about building a dashboard to monitor the current COVID-19 situation in Hong Kong for the Yuan Modeling Group at City University of Hong Kong. The scope of the project might be extended in the future.

The dashboard was deployed using Heroku and can be viewed <a href="https://covid19hk.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
